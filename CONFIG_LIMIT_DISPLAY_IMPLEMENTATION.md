# Config Limit Display Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a visible "config limit" section on the reseller dashboard for traffic-based resellers to see how many configs they can create.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. `Modules/Reseller/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php`
**Changes:**
- Added computation of config limit statistics for traffic-based resellers
- Calculates `config_limit`, `configs_remaining`, and `is_unlimited_limit`
- Handles null/0 config_limit as unlimited
- Uses Eloquent default scope (soft-deleted configs automatically excluded)

**Code Added:**
```php
$totalConfigs = $reseller->configs()->count();
$configLimit = $reseller->config_limit;
$isUnlimitedLimit = is_null($configLimit) || $configLimit === 0;
$configsRemaining = $isUnlimitedLimit ? null : max($configLimit - $totalConfigs, 0);
```

#### 2. `Modules/Reseller/resources/views/dashboard.blade.php`
**Changes:**
- Changed grid from 2-column to 3-column layout (sm:grid-cols-2 → lg:grid-cols-3)
- Added new teal-colored card for config limit display
- Shows "نامحدود" for unlimited configs
- Shows "X از Y" format with progress bar for limited configs
- Fully responsive and RTL-safe

**UI Elements:**
- Title: "محدودیت کانفیگ"
- Unlimited state: "نامحدود"
- Limited state: "{remaining} از {total}" + "باقیمانده" + progress bar
- Color: teal (bg-teal-50 / dark:bg-teal-900)

#### 3. `tests/Feature/ResellerDashboardTest.php`
**New Tests Added:**
1. `traffic based reseller with unlimited config limit shows نامحدود`
2. `traffic based reseller with zero config limit shows نامحدود`
3. `traffic based reseller with config limit shows remaining count`
4. `traffic based reseller with all configs used shows zero remaining`
5. `soft deleted configs do not reduce remaining count`

## Test Results
✅ All 9 tests passing (27 assertions)
- Non-reseller access control
- Plan-based reseller dashboard
- Traffic-based reseller dashboard
- Suspended reseller access control
- Unlimited config limit display (null)
- Unlimited config limit display (0)
- Limited config remaining count
- Zero remaining configs
- Soft-delete handling

## Requirements Met

### ✅ Functional Requirements
- [x] Show total limit and remaining count for traffic-based resellers
- [x] Display "unlimited" state when config_limit is null or 0
- [x] Counts exclude soft-deleted configs (Eloquent default scope)
- [x] RTL-safe Persian labels
- [x] No schema changes required

### ✅ Display Behavior
- [x] config_limit = null → "نامحدود"
- [x] config_limit = 0 → "نامحدود"
- [x] config_limit = 10, total = 7 → "3 از 10" with 70% progress bar
- [x] config_limit = 5, total = 5 → "0 از 5" with 100% progress bar

### ✅ Technical Requirements
- [x] Display-only (no creation logic changes)
- [x] Persian labels only for new elements
- [x] Maintains existing responsive design
- [x] Compatible with dark mode
- [x] No database migrations needed

## UI Preview
See screenshot at: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e2e1ee0-1216-48cd-85a0-c994438e04ef

The implementation shows:
1. **Unlimited reseller**: Clean "نامحدود" display
2. **Limited reseller (partial)**: "3 از 10" with progress bar showing usage
3. **Limited reseller (full)**: "0 از 5" with full progress bar
4. **Mobile responsive**: Single column layout on small screens
5. **Dark mode**: Proper contrast and theming

## Code Quality
- Minimal changes to existing code
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- Persian labels match existing dashboard style
- Responsive design consistent with current implementation
- No security vulnerabilities detected

## Notes
- Implementation is display-only and does not affect config creation enforcement
- Soft-deleted configs are automatically excluded via Eloquent's default scope
- Progress bar provides visual feedback on usage percentage
- Layout adapts gracefully from mobile (1 col) to tablet (2 col) to desktop (3 col)
